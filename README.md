# Reinforcement_learning with q-table

# This is a proof of concept that a reinforcement agent can determine which training intensities are best suited for an athlete to improve the times of a given distance.
# In this example, 2k times are created to represent an athlete. This athlete improves the most when the aerobic thershold makes up approx 70%-80% of the athletes training program.
# From this we can see that the agent discovers through exploration and the use of a q-table that the best training strategy is to keep the athlete between these 2 intensities.


# This developed in python and in jupyter notebook. To run you will need to install these.
